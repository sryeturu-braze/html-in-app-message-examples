## Getting Started  

To use this template in your Braze in-app messaging, follow these steps:
  

1.  **Create In-App Message**: Create a new in-app message campaign and select the "Custom Code" message type.

2.  **Copy and Paste HTML File**: Insert the code from `index.html` into the code editor.

3.  **Upload Assets**: Upload the assets into the drag and drop media library: `back.png`, `front.png`, `script.js`, and `styles.css`.

5.  **Test**: Ensure the in-app message correctly renders across different devices.
  
## Customization

Customize the in-app message to match a brand or style 
 
-  **Card Images**: Use different images for `front.png` and `back.png` images with your own to alter the design of the scratch-off surface and the hidden content. For best results, use images with a 9:16 aspect ratio (preferably 800px by 1422px) to optimize for mobile screens.
                    `front.png` refers to the top most image and `back.png` refers to the image that will be revealed.
