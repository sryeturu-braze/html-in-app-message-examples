## Getting Started  

To use this template in your Braze in-app messaging, follow these steps:
  

1.  **Create In-App Message**: Create a new in-app message campaign and select the "Custom Code" message type.

2.  **Copy and Paste HTML File**: Insert the code from `index.html` into the code editor.

3.  **Upload Assets**: Upload the assets into the drag and drop media library: `logo.png`, `img1.png` , `img2.png`, `img3.png`, `img4.png`, `script.js`, and `styles.css`.

## Customization

Customize the in-app message to match a brand or style 
 
-  **Card Images**: Upload alternate image assets with the same naming schema as above to customize the images that are displayed.
 
-  **Promo Code**: Replace the example promo code (`ELGYP29E` ) in `index.html` to your desired code or message. Be aware that the Braze out-of-the-box promotion code functionality [can't be used with in-app messages.](https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/promotion_codes/#step-1-navigate-to-the-promotion-code-section:~:text=Promotion%20codes%20can%E2%80%99t%20be%20sent%20in%20in%2Dapp%20messages.)
