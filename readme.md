## Game Logic

- The game consists of 8 cards (4 pairs).
- Cards are shuffled and displayed face down.
- Users click on cards to flip them over and try to find matching pairs.
- If a match is found, the cards remain flipped; if not, they flip back after a short delay.
- Once all pairs are matched, a promo code is displayed along with a fireworks animation.

## Customization

- **Card Images**: Replace the image filenames in the `cardsArray` with your own images.
- **Promo Code**: Change the promo code in the HTML where it says `ELGYP29E` to your desired code.
